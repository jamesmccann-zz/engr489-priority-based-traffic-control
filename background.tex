\chapter{Background and Related Work}

This chapter presents an introduction to adaptive signal control techniques used in existing, traffic control systems, and a brief review of literature related to research based on ``rolling horizon'' control techniques. Appendix \ref{appendix:terminology} introduces terminology that will be used in this section and through the remainder of this report. 

\section{Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System}

In New Zealand, all controlled intersections are operated by the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS). SCATS is a centralised, coordinated, adaptive traffic control system, first developed in Australia in 1982 and now in its 7th major version. SCATS operates on a networked computer with two-way communication to individual SCATS connected traffic controllers over broadband (or modem) connections. SCATS interfaces with roadside traffic signal control units, requesting phase times, skipping phases, or adjusting cycle lengths on an adaptive basis \cite{scatstraining,lowrie1982scats}.

SCATS incrementally adjusts the planned phase times of a traffic signal controller by responding to traffic data collected by the signal controller during the previous cycle. Inputs to SCATS from each individual controller include the number of vehicles and flow rate per each intersection approach, the expected and actual phase times, and the degree of saturation for the intersection.  The SCATS system calculates and requests phase times and cycle lengths in order to minimise the degree of saturation of an intersection, which is defined as a ratio of arrival flow rate to network capacity, \cite{sidraglossary}. The proportion of effectively used green time is typically increased using longer cycles and higher split times for high demand approaches. 

In a coordinated traffic control system, emphasis is given to ensuring that green times between two nearby intersections are scheduled in such a way as to allow for synchronised green phases, preventing vehicles arriving from an upstream intersection being required to stop downstream. The effect of this synchronisation is colloquially known as a ``corridor of green" and will be familiar to most New Zealand motorists. SCATS intersections are organised into groups called subsystems, typically based on proximity. A traffic control engineer identifies a critical intersection within each subsystem in a road network. The cycle time is optimised for the critical intersection and neighbouring intersections adopt the same cycle time to provide naive coordination of phases and ensure undersaturation of the critical intersection \cite{kilby2010rta}.

%The SCATS system works well for intersection sites with well established traffic flow periods, for example, highway intersections that have relatively even demand with single morning and evening peaks. 
In practice, SCATS is limited by the ability to adjust timings only at the conclusion of a cycle, and the relatively small incremental adjustments made between cycles. During peaks of high intersection demand, the time for a cycle length increases, typically as long as 120 seconds or higher. Adjustments made to phase and cycle times at the end of each cycle are typically within the range of 5\%-10\%. As a result, SCATS can be slow to respond to disruptive periods of high demand and requires manual intervention from traffic engineers to handle such situations \cite{scatstraining}.

\section{Splits-Cycle-Offsets-Optimization-Technique}

The Splits-Cycle-Offsets-Optimization-Technique (SCOOT) is an adaptive traffic control system first developed and deployed in the United Kingdom.

The primary objective of SCOOT is to minimise the sum of the average traffic queues in an area. SCOOT modelling is based on construction of so called ``cyclic flow profiles", online relative to real-time demand measured by detectors upstream of an intersection. A cyclic flow profile is a measure of a one-way flow of vehicles past a point (e.g. stop line) during a time step of a signal cycle. The use of cyclic flow profiles generated online in respond to actual traffic demand is promoted as an advantage of SCOOT over fixed-plan adaptive systems such as SCATS, as SCOOT does not require a traffic engineer to predetermine a set of plans based on expected traffic flow at an intersection \cite{bell1992future,robertson1991optimizing}.

The SCATS and SCOOT control systems are limited by the reliability of communication links between signal controllers and the central optimiser. If communication is interrupted or lost, signal controllers will revert to a fallback mode, using predefined plans designed by a traffic engineer. In order to maintain integrity of a network in the event of communication loss, fallback plans are updated regularly by traffic control engineers using historical data collected over a fixed time period, a costly operation which requires continuous maintenance. In addition, SCATS and SCOOT both rely on the use of inductive loops installed within the pavement of a road at intersection stop-lines or at an upstream location, which must be replaced each time the surface of the road is maintained  \cite{bell1992future}.

\section{Rolling-Horizon Optimisation}
\label{bg:rolling-horizon}

Rolling-horizon optimisation is a traffic control technique for delay minimisation using a future estimate of delay over a short fixed period of time, called the ``horizon''. The technique is based upon inspecting the movement of vehicles at a traffic network every $h$ seconds (e.g. 2 seconds), and determining whether intersection signals should be changed immediately or left as they are to continue the current phase. If the current phase is left to continue, the change will be reassessed in another $h$ seconds at the next iteration of the algorithm, hence the horizon ``rolls'' forward with time \cite{miller1963computer}. This algorithm is designed to minimise the overall delay time for the network and includes consideration of the additional delay time incurred if a phase change is delayed or changed for each approaching road link, for example, if a phase is not changed then additional delay is incurred by vehicles waiting at a red signal. The change is scheduled whenever the estimated delay for vehicles approaching a green signal being required to stop is less than the incurred delay for vehicles waiting at red signals.

The Predictive Microscopic Simulation Algorithm (PMSA), is an adaptive rolling-horizon algorithm based on communication received from vehicles near a traffic controller \cite{smith2010intellidrive}. The PMSA algorithm considers speed, heading, and location of vehicles approaching a controlled intersection to create a set of ``microscopic simulations'' to measure the impact of set of possible phase changes. Each microscopic simulation projects an estimate of the trajectory of every vehicle recognised by the system over a 20 second period and evaluates the phase change decision that produces the lowest simulated delay. Comparison between the PMSA system and existing adaptive traffic control methods is described as a potential area of future research by the authors. The PMSA system objectives are similar to the objectives of this project, although the system does not consider the urgency of travel, cost of stopping, or cost of delay for vehicles at an intersection.

Further research has considered alternatives to phase based control, in combination with rolling-horizon search techniques.  ALLONS-D is an adaptive lookahead control algorithm that uses a similar rolling-horizon lookahead optimisation step to minimise total delay at an intersection, with significantly improved results over fixed-time phase implementations \cite{porche1996allonsd}. Unfortunately, a lack of comparison with traffic actuated or adaptive controllers limit the results of the ALLONS-D evaluation and more work is needed in this area to compare with realistic traffic controllers. 

Movement-lookahead traffic optimisation allows vehicles to pass through an intersection in distinct \emph{movements}, which represent a passage of traffic from an approach lane to an exit lane, rather than structured phases or stages which are typically predefined sets of one or more movements  \cite{van2008movement,pandit2013adaptive}. Movement-based control allows for clearance of more approaches by starting and ending individual movements of non-conflicting movements of traffic as soon as they are demanded and available, rather than a entire phase. Movement-based adaptive traffic control is suggested as an improvement over the ALLONS-D phase-based control, even though the rolling-horizon optimisation steps are similar. Performance evaluation of the movement-lookahead control algorithm is carried out in \cite{van2008movement}, with significant reductions in delay time compared with vehicle-actuated and phase-based lookahead control algorithms. Results are limited to simulated implementations of the control schemes and traffic flow and no real-world testing has been conducted.

% do something with this shit 
%Signal control optimisation has been well researched with respect to minimising the total delay for all vehicles at a controlled intersection. Webster's method \cite{webster1958}, is a widely adopted and researched method for estimating optimal cycle length for minimal delay at a controlled intersection. For a saturated intersection, Webster's method provides an optimal cycle length with respect to minimal time lost between phases, between flows of opposing traffic.
