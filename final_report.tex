\begin{abstract}

The rising ubiquity of internet connected devices and wireless networks offers a bright future for intelligent transport systems in urban environments. By equipping individual vehicles with wireless devices capable of communicating with traffic signal controllers and developing models for estimation of the cost of travel for individual vehicles, adaptive traffic control schemes can be used to prioritise traffic flows, minimise delay based on traffic priority, and reduce the rising costs of congestion within urban road networks.

The Priority Based Traffic Control system (PBTC) is a new method of adaptive traffic control designed to take advantage of the opportunities allowed by a fully connected traffic fleet. The PBTC system is designed to adapt to local traffic conditions in real time, minimising the congestion costs incurred by road users, by establishing wireless communication with vehicles approaching a controlled intersection and estimating the potential stopping cost and delay cost for each vehicle. Lookahead estimation allows a signal controller to extend green time dynamically to further reduce the cost associated with phase changes. 

This report presents the PBTC system architecture and control algorithm, methods used to estimate and minimise the costs of delaying approaching traffic at a controlled intersection, a developed software tool for simulating prioritised traffic and results of evaluation detailing the performance benefit of the PBTC method against vehicle actuated and adaptive traffic control methods.
